<h2>Hello, I'm Maxim!</h2>
<p>
    I am a Senior Data Scientist at the Swiss Data Science Center of ETH Zurich and EPFL. I am interested in extending AI techniques to provide useful tools to relevant real-world challenges and I work in different projects as a Machine Learning specialist and software engineer.
<p>
    In the past years, I worked on developing new methods in <strong>generative AI</strong> (see e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdbSLlmBTBI">my conference talk</a> on our work in <strong>discovering novel molecules</strong>), on <strong>computer vision applications for object detection</strong> in challenging real-world problems (see e.g. <a href="https://slideslive.com/38941241/segmentation-of-soil-degradation-sites-in-swiss-alpine-grasslands-with-deep-learning">my NeurIPS workshop talk</a> on <strong>erosion site detection</strong> or our project video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylL85PxXds8">Tracking soil erosion with Big Data</a>" produced by the <strong>SNF</strong>), and on improving our insights on why neural networks work that remarkably well (see e.g. our <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v180/samarin22a.html">UAI paper</a>).

    I completed my PhD as a doctoral researcher in computer science in the <a href="https://bmda.dmi.unibas.ch/">Biomedical Data Analysis group</a> of Professor Volker Roth. Before that I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in physics at the <strong>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich</strong> and spent a semester in the Complex Systems Master’s programme at <strong>École normale supérieure (ENS) de Lyon</strong>.

    In addition to my work as a Senior Data Scientist, I lecture classes on <a href="https://fortbildung.unibas.ch/courses/organizer/transferable-skills/python-crash-course-for-beginners-296877">Python programming</a> and <a href="https://github.com/samarinm/APML">machine learning</a>.
