<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am currently concluding my dissertation and looking for a new job opportunity in context of machine learning and deep learning. In past years, I've been a doctoral researcher in computer science in the <a href="https://bmda.dmi.unibas.ch/">Biomedical Data Analysis group</a> of Professor Volker Roth. Previously, I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and spent a semester in the Complex Systems Master’s programme at École normale supérieure (ENS) de Lyon.</p>
<p>
I have a broad interest in machine learning and application of data analytics tools. In my research I work on information theoretic approaches to deep latent variable models and structured latent representations, image segmentation in real-world settings, as well as Deep Learning theory in the context of Gaussian Processes and the Neural Tangent Kernel to reason about practical preformance aspects of deep neural networks. In our <a href="https://p3.snf.ch/Project-167333">weObserve research project</a>, we use these methods to identify soil degradation areas from aerial images and investigate bird migration with the goal of establishing new insights into these phenomena by combing heterogeneous data sources and Citizen Science. Further applications involve facilitating the discovery of novel molecules with desirable properties.
</p>
<p>In my projects, I mainly work in Python and the frameworks and platforms of TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX, CUDA and others. I also teach a <a href="https://github.com/samarinm/pythonCC/">Python crash course</a> once a semester, and I tutored in the lectures on <a href="https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/investigation?id=259473">Bioinformatics Algorithms</a> and <a href="https://vorlesungsverzeichnis.unibas.ch/en/investigation?id=234639">Information Theory</a>.</p><br>
