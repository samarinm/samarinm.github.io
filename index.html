<h2>Hello, I'm Maxim!</h2>
<p>
    I recently obtained my PhD in machine learning and I am currently looking for new exciting opportunities in machine learning and deep learning! I am interested in extending these "AI" techniques to provide useful tools to current relvant challenges. 
</p>
<p>
    In the past years, I worked on developing new methods in generative AI (see e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdbSLlmBTBI">my conference talk</a> on our work in discovering novel molecules), on computer vision applications for object detection in challenging real-world problems (see e.g. <a href="https://slideslive.com/38941241/segmentation-of-soil-degradation-sites-in-swiss-alpine-grasslands-with-deep-learning">my NeurIPS workshop talk</a> on erosion site detection), and on improving our insights on why neural networks work that remarkably well (see e.g. our <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v180/samarin22a.html">UAI paper</a>). 
</p>
<p>
    I've been a doctoral researcher in computer science in the <a href="https://bmda.dmi.unibas.ch/">Biomedical Data Analysis group</a> of Professor Volker Roth. Before that I completed my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and spent a semester in the Complex Systems Master’s programme at École normale supérieure (ENS) de Lyon.

    Currently, I lecture <a href="https://fortbildung.unibas.ch/courses/organizer/scientific-tools/python-crash-course-for-beginners-296174">Python programming</a> and <a href="https://fortbildung.unibas.ch/courses/organizer/scientific-tools/advanced-python-and-machine-learning-296175">Machine Learning</a>.
