<h2>Hello, I'm Maxim!</h2>
<p>
    I recently obtained my PhD in machine learning and I am currently looking for new exciting opportunities in machine learning and deep learning! I am interested in extending AI techniques to provide useful tools to relevant real-world challenges.
<p>
    In the past years, I worked on developing new methods in <strong>generative AI</strong> (see e.g. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdbSLlmBTBI">my conference talk</a> on our work in <strong>discovering novel molecules<strong>), on <strong>computer vision applications for object detection<strong> in challenging real-world problems (see e.g. <a href="https://slideslive.com/38941241/segmentation-of-soil-degradation-sites-in-swiss-alpine-grasslands-with-deep-learning">my NeurIPS workshop talk</a> on <strong>erosion site detection<strong>), and on improving our insights on why neural networks work that remarkably well (see e.g. our <a href="https://proceedings.mlr.press/v180/samarin22a.html">UAI paper</a>). 
</p>
<p>
    I completed my PhD as a doctoral researcher in computer science in the <a href="https://bmda.dmi.unibas.ch/">Biomedical Data Analysis group</a> of Professor Volker Roth. Before that I obtained my Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in physics at the <strong>Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich<strong> and spent a semester in the Complex Systems Master’s programme at <strong>École normale supérieure (ENS) de Lyon<strong>.

    Currently, I lecture classes on <a href="https://fortbildung.unibas.ch/courses/organizer/scientific-tools/python-crash-course-for-beginners-296174">Python programming</a> and <a href="https://fortbildung.unibas.ch/courses/organizer/scientific-tools/advanced-python-and-machine-learning-296175">machine learning</a>.
